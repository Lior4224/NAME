About Adventure Farmer

Adventure Farmer is a simulation of a new farm that can progress in various ways, such as different crops, amount of crops, crop prices, and more.
It includes other variables such as weather conditions, balance, hard-to-grow plants, etc. Each crop will have its own conditions, 
with its survivability depending on the weather of each day. When plants have grown, they can be sold for profit, and the player will 
be able to buy more seeds to grow.

How to Launch Adventure Farmer

After initiating the program (javac woo.java -> java woo), the player will be asked to name their farm. For every in-game day, the player can choose to buy or sell a type 
of plant based on the daily farm report. They can input the amount of seeds of that type to buy. They can input 0 
if the balance is not enough or simply wish to move on to the next day.
